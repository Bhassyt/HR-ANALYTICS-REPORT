## Project Overview
---
This HR Analytics project aims to examine the factors influencing employee attrition within the organization over the past years. Through a comprehensive analysis of various   parameters in the provided data, our objective is to gain valuable insights that will inform strategic decisions. This process will enable us to construct compelling narratives around our data findings and identify the key contributors to employee retention or turnover. By understanding the factors driving attrition, we can implement targeted measures to enhance employee engagement and foster a positive work environment, ultimately reducing the organization's attrition rate.

## Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "hr_data.xlsx" file, containing comprehensive information about each employee in the organization. The HR dataset contains key attributes related to employee profiles, job details, performance, and satisfaction metrics. Analyzing these attributes will help identify attrition drivers and develop strategies for improving employee retention. Some of the key attributes includes:

- Attrition: This column indicates whether an employee has left the company or not.
- CF_age band: This column categorizes employees into age bands.
- Department: This column represents the department in which an employee works.
- Education Field: This column indicates the field of study of an employee.
- Gender: This column represents the gender of an employee.
- Job Role: This column indicates the job title or role of an employee within the organization.
- Marital Status: This column represents the marital status of an employee (e.g., Single, Married, Divorced).
- CF_current Employee: This column indicate whether an employee is currently employed or not (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- Education: This column represents the highest level of education attained by an employee.
- Employee Count: This column represent the total number of employees.
