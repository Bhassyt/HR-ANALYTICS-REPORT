## Project Overview
---
This HR Analytics project aims to examine the factors influencing employee attrition within the organization over the past year. Through a comprehensive analysis of various   parameters in the provided data, our objective is to gain valuable insights that will inform strategic decisions. This process will enable us to construct compelling narratives around our data findings and identify the key contributors to employee retention or turnover. By understanding the factors driving attrition, we can implement targeted measures to enhance employee engagement and foster a positive work environment, ultimately reducing the organization's attrition rate.

## Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "hr_data.xlsx" file, containing comprehensive information about each employee in the organization.
